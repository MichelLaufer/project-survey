# Build a survey form using React

This week's project in the Technigo boot camp was to use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. Our completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

We could choose what we would like our survey to be about. Once a user has submitted the survey we have created, it doesn't actually need to be submitted anywhere - the focus here is to practice using React state and controlling forms.
