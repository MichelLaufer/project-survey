# Building a survey form using React

The tenth week's project in the Technigo bootcamp was to use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. The focus was to practice using React state and controlling forms.

Tech:
<br>React.js, JavaScript(ES6), HTML, CSS</br>

I used several components and useState. I used text-input, a set of radio buttons, dropdowns and a range slider. I also used a progress bar to show the user how much of the survey that was completed.
